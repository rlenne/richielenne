abstract = "Objective:Interpersonal relationships are important predictors of health outcomes, and interpersonal influences on behaviours may represent key mechanisms underlying sucheffects.Most health behaviour theories focus on intrapersonalfactors and may not adequately account for interpersonalinfluences. We evaluate a dyadic extension of the Theory of Planned Behaviour byexamininghow adolescent and parent characteristics (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, intentions) predict not only their own, but each other’s intentions/behaviours. Design:Using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model, weanalyse responses from 1,717parent-adolescentdyadsfromtheFamilyLife,Activity,Sun,Health,andEating(FLASHE) study. Main Outcome Measures: Adolescents/parents completed self-reports of theirfruit and vegetable consumption, junk food and sugary drinks consumption, engagement in physical activity, and engagement in screen time sedentary behaviours.Results:We find thatparent and adolescent characteristics predicteach other’s health-relevant intentions/behaviours,and that theseeffects emerge above the predictive ability of individuals’ own characteristics.Parent/adolescent characteristics predict each other’s outcomes at similar levels, but parent characteristics more strongly predict adolescent intentions, whereas adolescent characteristics more strongly predict parent behaviours. Conclusions: Parents and adolescents may bidirectionally influence each other’s health intentions/behaviours. This highlights the importance of dyadic models of health behaviour and suggests interventiontargets."
