# Research Brief

My research program focuses on developing psychological theory, and applying it to public health intervention and healthcare delivery. I take a multimethod approach to research on topics such as physical activity, diet, stress, and well-being. Representative projects include: (1) developing dynamic computational models for processes underlying health behavior change; (2) testing theoretically-grounded interventions targeted at lifestyle behaviors; (3) examining principles of effective health communication; and (4) modeling how relationship dynamics shape health beliefs and behavior. Beyond my work on health, I am interested in meta-science, reproducibility, openness, and theory development and testing. For example, I am part of a large interdisciplinary collaboration evaluating the effect of a journalâ€™s open data policy, and meta-analyzing replications of a highly-cited psychology study.

My research documentation (i.e., code, data, materials, preregistrations) are primarily on the [open science framework](https://osf.io/h5tve/). My preprint and postprint manuscripts are open access at [PsyArXiv](http://bit.ly/LennePsyArXiv). I occasional blog, [here](https://socialmethods.wordpress.com/).
