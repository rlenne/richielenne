# Research Brief

My research program focuses on the relevance of psychological theory to public health intervention and healthcare delivery. I work across a broad array of health domains and address a range of issues such as (1) developing dynamical computational models for processes of behavior change; (2) testing theoretically-driven interventions targeted at lifestyle behaviors; (3) examining processes of effective health communication and its relationship to everyday conversation about lifestyle changes; (4) modelling how interpersonal processes and relationships shape health beliefs and behavior; and (5) developing tools and strategies for better specifying, testing, and applying psychological theory.

My research documentation (i.e., code, data, materials, preregistrations) are primarily on the [open science framework](https://osf.io/h5tve/). My preprint and postprint manuscripts are open access at [PsyArXiv](http://bit.ly/LennePsyArXiv). I occasional blog, [here](https://socialmethods.wordpress.com/).
