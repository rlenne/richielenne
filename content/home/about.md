# Research Brief

My research applies psychological theory and behavioral science to public health intervention and healthcare delivery. I study topics such as physical activity, diet, stress, social relationships, and well-being with a focus on processes that sustain behavioral changes. I approach these topics from multiple angles using a diverse set of statistics, methods, theories, and technologies. 

Representative projects include: (1) developing dynamic computational models for processes underlying health behavior change; (2) testing theoretically-grounded interventions targeted at lifestyle behaviors; (3) examining principles of effective health communication; and (4) modeling how relationship dynamics shape health beliefs and behavior. 

I am interested in many other topics that intersect health/psychology, such as meta-science, reproducibility, philosophy of science, openness, data visualization, mobile tech, and theory development and testing. I contribute to several large interdisciplinary collaborations in these domains.

My research documentation (i.e., code, data, materials, preregistrations) are primarily on the [open science framework](https://osf.io/h5tve/). My preprint and postprint manuscripts are open access at [OSFpreprints](https://bit.ly/LenneOSFpreprints). I occasional blog, [here](https://socialmethods.wordpress.com/).
