# Research Brief

My research program focuses on the relevance of psychological theory to public health intervention and healthcare delivery. I take a multimethod approach to the study of health issues associated with physical activity, diet, stress, and well-being. Representative research topics include: (1) developing dynamic computational models for processes of health behavior change; (2) testing theoretically-driven interventions targeted at lifestyle behaviors; (3) examining processes of effective health communication; and (4) modeling how relationship dynamics shape health beliefs and behavior. Beyond my work on issues of health, I have a broader interest in meta-science, reproducibility, openness, and theory development and testing. For example, I have contributed to large interdisciplinary collaborations in which we evaluated the effect of a journalâ€™s open data policy, and meta-analyzed replication studies of a highly-cited psychological finding.

My research documentation (i.e., code, data, materials, preregistrations) are primarily on the [open science framework](https://osf.io/h5tve/). My preprint and postprint manuscripts are open access at [PsyArXiv](http://bit.ly/LennePsyArXiv). I occasional blog, [here](https://socialmethods.wordpress.com/).
